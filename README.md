# Bachelor thesis
ARE DEEP LEARNING METHODS BETTER FOR MOVIE REVIEW SENTIMENT ANALYSIS? 

Code for the experimental setup of the thesis: 
- the pre-processing of the data set, 
- the baseline algorithm: Logistic Regression, 
- the Deep Learning algorithm: LSTM.

The following LSTM codes are uploaded:
-	LSTM1: 	LSTM with default parameters,
-	LSTM2: 	LSTM with tuned parameters, 
-	LSTM2a:	LSTM with a tuned dropout rate,
-	LSTM2b: LSTM with a tuned learning rate &
-	LSTM2c:	LSTM with two hidden (dense) layers.
