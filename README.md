# Bachelor thesis
ARE DEEP LEARNING METHODS BETTER FOR MOVIE REVIEW SENTIMENT ANALYSIS? 

Code for the experimental setup of the thesis: 
- the summary & boxplot of the data set, 
- the baseline algorithm: Logistic Regression, 
- the Deep Learning algorithm: LSTM,
- the bar chart of the performance comparison.

The following LSTM codes are uploaded:
-	LSTM1: 	      LSTM with default parameters and dropout,
-	LSTM2: 	      LSTM with the best tuned parameters and no dropout, 
-	LSTM2a:	      LSTM with a tuned dropout rate, 
- LSTM2a (CV):  LSTM with 3-fold Cross-Validation for tuning the dropout rate &
-	LSTM2b:	      LSTM with two hidden (dense) layers and dropout.
